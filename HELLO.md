# Inventory App

### By Andrii, Hannah, Mariam and Murray

This is our project for our apprenticeship course. It is an inventory app in which the user can add items to a database, and have a visual representation of what items they have returned to them, it includes extra information such as the prices and a brief description of items. Users are also able to add new items to the list when necessary, being able to change the information on existing items and a delete feature to remove items no longer being stored.
